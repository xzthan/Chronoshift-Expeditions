                <p>Chronoshift Expeditions consists of dedicated tour guides, known as "The Dream Team." The guides are responsible for operating every trip through time. Chronoshift Expeditions was created after the founder, Isaak Maldonado, conceived the
                    idea after his ten-thousandth hour on Call of Duty: Warzone. Mr. Maldonado identified a glitch that let him travel back in time to hunt enemies and expel them from the game. Nonetheless, the mental processes spent on his gaming chair
                    are those that brought the world Chronoshift Expeditions.</p>

                <h2 style="text-align:center">History</h2>
                <p>The first historic capture is honorably known as Rexy, and Chronoshift Expeditions is committed to guaranteeing hunters their very own Rexy through honor, valor, and curiosity. The first expedition was taken to the Mesozoic Era, and each
                    hunter was allowed to hunt their prehistoric reptile; however, that privilege has since been forgone concerning federal guidelines regarding time manipulation. However, Mr. Maldonado commenced this process, and every hunter has followed
                    suit with the same desire: dignity.
