                <h2 style="text-align:center">Rules and Safety</h2>
                <p>All participants of any Chronoshift Expedition-provided service are expected to stay on the Time Protection Platform. Should any participant disobey these guidelines, said participant will face reproductions. These reproductions include
                    federal time served, a $10,000 fine, and a lost down payment. It is in the best interest of all participants to obey these guidelines as they encourage the safety of all hunters and even time. Participants are also expected to complete
                    mandatory seven-day training. Should a hunter be unwilling to continue in their hunt and abandon the team, they, too, will face a $10,000 fine and will lose their downpayment. The total sum of disrespect of any of these rules is $20,000
                    and possibly time served.

                <h2 style="text-align:center">Risks</h2>
                <p>Should a hunter not shoot a target when instructed, everyone involved is at risk of death. As such, participants who disobey or fail to perform when a team leader instructs a hunter to shoot a target are at risk of a $10,000 fine and the
                    loss of their down payment. However, the down payment also has a sticker price of $10,000, meaning the total loss would be approximately $20,000. Furthermore, stepping off the platform jeopardizes the integrity and fragility of time,
                    and Federal action may be in pursuit. All the risks of interacting with prehistoric creatures are not at the fault of Chronoshift Expeditions and are an accepted condition upon registering for an expedition. However, Chronoshift Expeditions
                    attempts to maintain these regulations in coordination with the federal government through strict fines to all participants through operant conditioning. </p>
